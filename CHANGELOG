## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2019-01-09

### Added
- `:max_plaintext_bytes` option to place an upper limit on the number of bytes
  returned. Also limits the amount of data that is actually read from plain text
  files and external command output to limit memory usage. Set this on the
  resolver object.

### Changed
- the unrtf handler now strips the preamble which unrtf adds to its output.
- text from external command handlers is now converted to UTF-8 before it's returned.
